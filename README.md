# ðŸ”´XREC

(A collection of kludges for recording screen/windows on X11)

- `xrec.py`: launch a command, wait for it to spawn a new window, then try to
  record it with ffmpeg
- `record-window.sh`: record a specified window by clicking it
- `record-screen.sh`: record the whole screen

Example usage:

    xrec.py ./my-program.sh

Waits 0.5s for my-program to create a window, then records it with ffmpeg
